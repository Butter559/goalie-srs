# NHL Goalie Analysis

This project was intended to look at a new way to go about valuing a goalie in the NHL, called a Sharpe Ratio, and see how well it correlates with salary, among other things. 

### Background
This project was for a math class in college, and I thoroughly enjoyed putting it together. Ultimately, this was inspired by another project intended to look at a goalies prime years, or years in which he performed above his career average.

### Contributions
I am not accepting contributions at this time.
